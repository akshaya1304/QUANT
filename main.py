#i had run this code in python file inside and environment E2 in anaconda GUI. 
#you can access this file by typing <streamlit run main.py> inside administrator
#i had used streamlit to integrate backend and frontend interface
#and trained the model from scratch here using linear regression method and not using libraries like ski-learn ect:
#python model is saved in pickel, uploaded and opened in pandas, indicators and calculated manually using NumPy and ML trained using neural network here
#its a combination of weights and activation values which through summation in each line finally traines the machine to either BUY or SELL
#SMA (Simple Moving Average)= summation(Closing price on each day)/ no. of days
#RSI (Relative Strength Index)RSI is a momentum indicator that measures how overbought or oversold an asset is
